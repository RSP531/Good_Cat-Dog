 * [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/)
 
 * [DogAPI](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)

## Technical Challenges and research that you anticipated

    * Postman was used to test GET requests from the two API's
  
## Challenges that were unexpected

    * 2 days to create a "Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Application"
    * Managing state was difficult between tabs. In the future I would like to learn Redux to manage state between tabs
    * I could not npm install anything. This was unexpected. In the future I would like to understand why Expo could not handle this
       * MongoAtlas
       * No Gesture Handlers
  
## Video Demo

## How does the app work (behind the scenes)?

    * Images are generated from two separate API's
    * "Good" images are stored in an array and rendered in the ScrollView

## What research was required?

## Future features to be implemented

    * Gesture handling Swipe Features 
    * Additional dev ops considerations?
    * UI/UX additions?
