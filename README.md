## Introduction

An Android/iOS Application to sift through Cat & Dog images and rate them as good or bad. This Ractive Native application was created in 2-days. React Native was learned during the process.

This project was a brief 1-week sprint where our team tried to complete an MVP for an external user **(Jane Doe)**

## What does the app do? 

    * App shows a list of Cat images & gifs
    * User can select if Cat is Good or Bad
    * Good Cats will be added to Favorites List and shown in the Scroll View
    * Bad Cats will be removed and a new image/gif will be generated
    * Similar

## Technical Challenges and research that you anticipated

    * Two Api's were used 
    * What did you learn?
  
## Challenges that were unexpected

    * 2 days to create a "Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Application"
    * Managing state was difficult between tabs. In the future I would like to learn Redux to manage state between tabs

## How does the app work?

    * What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it? 
    * OR What are all the place the data travels?  What happens to that data?
    * Optionally include a diagram
    * How does the tech stack come together?

## What research was required?

## Workflow and Key lessons from your team - specifically those related to: Agile, CI/CD, testing, working with external stakeholders, ticketing, and user stories.

    * Your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc
    * What did you learn from the process
    * What were key takeaways from stand ups, code reviews, etc
    * Writing tests
    * Link to your trello board, discuss completed tickets

## Any non-MVP tickets (optional)

 - Code refactorings
 - Performance Optimizations
 - Additional features
 - etc

## Notes from your Sprint Retro



## What additional features do you plan to add, how do you plan to implement those features?

    * Future refactoring?
    * Additional dev ops considerations?
    * UI/UX additions?
